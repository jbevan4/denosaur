# Denosaur

A side project investigating [Deno](https://deno.land/)

## Motivation

After using Node for a few years, I found that I was struggling with certain concepts as a package.json and integrating bundlers, formatters and test runners. After finding [this](youtube.com/watch?v=M3BM9TB-8yA&ab_channel=JSConf) video, I thought why not explore Deno.

## Installation

Provide step by step series of examples and explanations about how to get a development env running.

## API Reference

Depending on the size of the project, if it is small and simple enough the reference docs can be added to the README. For medium size to larger projects it is important to at least provide a link to where the API reference docs live.

## Tests

Describe and show how to run the tests with code examples.

## How to use?
